1. A Gashapon machine of the toy collection
   A playful experience to look at an overlooked collection of art/

2. A tile drum
   Would like to experience how color can be transformed into sound; haven't decided yet which set to use, either tiles or inlays

3. A extension of my previous qualitative Projects, more polished UI and navigation; adding more layers of information.
