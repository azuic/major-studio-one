2. Using cameras to record the number of visitors and average staying time, showing on the map as bars.
3. Record the sound visitors are making in realtime. Showing a sound wave graph for the average across all exhibition rooms and each room can have their own sound diagram as well.
4. It is a way to study and learn about the visitors' interactive behaviors with the museum collections.
5. Some places have realtime maps with queing time for visitors to refer to so that they can plan their time efficiently (usually amusement parks etc.), but in the MET, which is a museum setting that tends to be generally quiet, even any sound people unintentially make can be detected if the surrounding is silent enough. In such a special environment, it will be interesting to look into the sound.
